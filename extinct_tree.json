The fossil tree is much less complete, and often only shows higher-level groups rather than individual species (e.g. _Tyrannosaurus_, rather than _Tyrannosaurus rex_). Additionally, most fossil species are known from a handful of teeth or bones, so reconstructions of the whole animal can be somewhat speculative.",

For this reason, the fossil tree is currently not a complete or authoritative source of information. Nevertheless, we hope it will help you to explore the relationships between fossil and living species."
